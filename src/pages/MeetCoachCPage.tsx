          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            We've worked with athletes of all ages â€” from middle school players to collegiate athletes, and with coaches and parents, too. The mental game is not just for athletes, but for everyone around them.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold font-heading text-brand-blue mb-4">About The Mental Lab: Our Journey</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            The Mental Lab was founded by a coach who has been immersed in the world of sports for over 20 years â€” as a college basketball player, assistant high school coach, and middle school head coach.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Throughout our coaching history, we saw how mental blocks often stood between athletes and their potential. We've coached:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-700 mb-4 pl-4">
            <li>Boys' basketball teams to three straight championship appearances</li>
            <li>Girls' teams to undefeated seasons and league titles</li>
            <li>Middle schoolers to multiple finals in just three years</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            But it was during these moments of competition that we realized something deeper â€” the need to coach the mental game just as much as the physical one. <strong>And we noticed that the athletes who thrived had parents who knew how to support, not pressure.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            That passion led to earning a Master's in Sport Psychology at the prestigious John F. Kennedy University (now National University). Since then, we've helped athletes in sports like basketball, golf, tennis, baseball, and softball develop the mindset they need to thrive â€” <strong>while teaching their parents how to be part of the solution.</strong>
