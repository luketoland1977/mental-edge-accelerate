            <li className="flex items-start"><Zap className="w-6 h-6 text-yellow-500 mr-3 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" /><span><strong className="text-slate-800">Focus:</strong> Training the mind to stay sharp, even in high-pressure situations.</span></li>

          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            These are skills Iâ€™ve been taught, but more importantly, they are skills Iâ€™ve applied on the field with athletes who have gone on to achieve success. My goal is to help athletes master their mental game, so they can reach their fullest potential.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Iâ€™ve worked with athletes of all ages â€” from middle school players to collegiate athletes, and with coaches and parents, too. The mental game is not just for athletes, but for everyone around them.

          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Hi, Iâ€™m Coach C, and Iâ€™ve been immersed in the world of sports for over 20 years â€” as a college basketball player, assistant high school coach, and middle school head coach.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Throughout my career, I saw how mental blocks often stood between athletes and their potential. Iâ€™ve coached:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-700 mb-4 pl-4">
            <li>Boysâ€™ basketball teams to three straight championship appearances</li>
            <li>Girlsâ€™ teams to undefeated seasons and league titles</li>
            <li>Middle schoolers to multiple finals in just three years</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            But it was during these moments of competition that I realized something deeper â€” the need to coach the mental game just as much as the physical one.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            That passion led me to earn a Masterâ€™s in Sport Psychology at the prestigious John F. Kennedy University (now National University). Since then, Iâ€™ve helped athletes in sports like basketball, golf, tennis, baseball, and softball develop the mindset they need to thrive.

            After two decades on the court, Iâ€™ve shifted my full focus to mental performance coaching. Itâ€™s time for athletes to treat their mind like a muscle â€” one that needs training, conditioning, and care.
